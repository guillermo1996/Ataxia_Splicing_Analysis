# Ataxia Splicing Noise Analysis

This repository contains the code related to the splicing analysis on Ataxia RNAseq samples. 

The code presented here is based on the [splicing-accuracy-manuscript](https://github.com/SoniaRuiz/splicing-accuracy-manuscript) repository from Sonia Garc√≠a Ruiz, and was developed in order to provide additional information regarding the effects ataxia on splicing accuracy.

## Analyses

### Median MSR studies

Analysis focused on the differences in mis-splicing ratio medians between cases and controls for different levels of study. Provided [report](https://guillermo1996.github.io/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/RMarkdown/Ataxia_Pseudobulk_MedianMSR.html) and [code](https://github.com/guillermo1996/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/blob/main/RMarkdown/Ataxia_Pseudobulk_MedianMSR.Rmd).

### Distances, deltaMES and MSR distribution studies

Analysis focused on the differences in distances, deltaMES and MSR distributions between cases and controls for different levels of study. Provided [report](https://guillermo1996.github.io/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/RMarkdown/Ataxia_Pseudobulk_Distances.html) and [code](https://github.com/guillermo1996/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/blob/main/RMarkdown/Ataxia_Pseudobulk_Distances.Rmd).

### Junction category distribution

A series of reports studying the junction category distributions. These reports are based on the research by Regina H. Reynolds ([GitHub](https://github.com/RHReynolds/LBD-seq-bulk-analyses)):

* Leafcutter junction categories: [code](https://github.com/guillermo1996/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/blob/main/RMarkdown/Leafcutter_Junction_categories.Rmd) and [report](https://guillermo1996.github.io/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/RMarkdown/Leafcutter_Junction_categories.html).

* STAR junction categories: [code](https://github.com/guillermo1996/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/blob/main/RMarkdown/STAR_Junction_categories.Rmd) and [report](https://guillermo1996.github.io/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/RMarkdown/STAR_Junction_categories.html).

* Targeted gene junction categories: [code](https://github.com/guillermo1996/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/blob/main/RMarkdown/Gene_Junction_categories.Rmd) and [report](https://guillermo1996.github.io/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/RMarkdown/Gene_Junction_categories.html).
