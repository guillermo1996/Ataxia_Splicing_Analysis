# Background
> Aim: update the studies carried out by Regina H. Reynolds about introns' annotation distributions. Source material: [Leafcutter: intron annotation and visualisation](https://rhreynolds.github.io/LBD-seq-bulk-analyses/quantification_splicing/Leafcutter_intron_annotation.html)

This report is meant to be used as a template. As such, the different sections will include instructions on how to modify the graphic outputs and not descriptions about the results themselves.

To run this script, it is necessary to source the file at `/home/grocamora/Core_Projects/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/R/Leafcutter_introns.R` with needed helper functions.

# Annotate introns

First, we need to specify some variables to use across the RMarkdown. 

The visualizations expressed here employ ENSEMBL v105 for annotations (modify the path to the gtf in the variable `gtf_path`). I tested with GENCODE v43, but the annotation process did not properly work (I assume it must be due to a different start/end position, but haven't have time to check).

```{r, echo = T}
# Since the cluster IDs don't have a valid strand, we set this argument to FALSE
# to ignore the strands
use_strand <- F

# Path to the gtf file to annotate the introns
gtf_path <- "/home/grocamora/RytenLab-Research/Additional_files/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.105.gtf"
#gtf_path <- "/home/grocamora/RytenLab-Research/Additional_files/GENCODE/gencode.v43.annotation.gtf"

# Dictionary to rename the comparisons in the plot
intron_type_labels <- c("annotated" = "Annotated", "novel_donor" = "Novel Donor", 
                        "novel_acceptor" = "Novel Acceptor", 
                        "novel_combo" = "Novel Combo", "novel_exon_skip" = "Novel Exon Skip", 
                        "unannotated" = "Unannotated")

intron_type_levels <- c("annotated", "novel_acceptor", "novel_donor", 
                        "novel_exon_skip", "novel_combo", "unannotated")
```

## Loading leafcutter results

Then, we load the leafcutter results from disk. Three different studies will be presented in this report: overall (Level 1), subtypes (Level 2) and diagnoses (Level 3). Types 2 and 3 will be further split by tissues.

```{r, echo = T}
path_to_results <- "/home/grocamora/Core_Projects/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/summary_results"
leafcutter_list <-  setNames(list(
  readRDS(file.path(path_to_results, "case_v_control_leafcutter_ds.Rds")),
  readRDS(file.path(path_to_results, "subtypes_v_control_leafcutter_ds.Rds")),
  readRDS(file.path(path_to_results, "diagnoses_v_control_leafcutter_ds.Rds"))),
  c("overall", "subtypes", "diagnoses"))
```

## Annotation process

The junctions are annotated using the function `junction_annot` from David Zhang's package [`dasper`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dasper.html) version 1.7.0. 

It takes around 20 minutes to execute the annotation process of all three levels.

```{r, echo = T}
# Path to where the annotated intron list will be stored in disk.
annotated_path <- "/home/grocamora/Core_Projects/Ataxia_Splicing_Analysis/variables/annotated_gencode43.rds"

# If file already exists, do not execute the annotation process.
if(!file.exists(annotated_path)){
  # Load the reference transcriptome
  TxDb_ref <- dasper:::ref_load(gtf_path)
  
  # Some reference transcriptomes (i.e. Gencode) use the characters "chr" before
  # the seqnames. To bring consistency, the "seqlevelsStyle" is set to "NCBI".
  seqlevelsStyle(TxDb_ref) <- c("NCBI")
  
  annotated <- leafcutter_list %>% purrr::map(function(x){
    # Extract the successful clusters
    success_cluster <- x$cluster_significance %>%
      dplyr::filter(status == "Success") %>% 
      dplyr::pull(cluster) %>% 
      unique()
    
    # Transform the data from leafcutter to a valid GRanges object to run the annotation
    annotated_introns <- x$intron_usage %>%
      tidyr::separate(col = "intron", into = c("chr", "start", "end", "cluster_id"), sep = ":", remove = F) %>%
      dplyr::mutate(cluster_id = str_c(chr, ":", cluster_id)) %>%
      dplyr::filter(cluster_id %in% success_cluster) %>%
      convert_leafcutter(use_strand = use_strand) %>%
      dasper::junction_annot(ref = TxDb_ref)
    
    # Once the introns are annotated, we remove all the annotated introns that
    # are associated to more than one gene.
    annotated_introns <- removeAmbiguousGenes(annotated_introns)
    
    return(annotated_introns)
  })
  
  # Save the annotated list in disk.
  annotated %>% saveRDS(annotated_path)
}else{
  annotated <- readRDS(annotated_path)
}
```

## Proportion of annotated introns {.tabset}

We use the function `printTypeTable` to print a table with the proportion of significant junctions by category. Results are not split by tissue. The significant column denotes the number of introns by annotation type that were found significantly differentially spliced. [Original Source](https://rhreynolds.github.io/LBD-seq-bulk-analyses/quantification_splicing/Leafcutter_intron_annotation.html#annotating-introns).

# Visualization of overlapping events

Different visualizations will be presented replicating Regina's results, but adapting the code to remove depecrated functions and adding the option to use non-stranded clusters.

## Proportion of annotation types within each comparison {.tabset}

Visualization of the proportion of junction categories by comparison and tissue. We use the function `plotProportionOfAnnotation` with the parameters explained next. Relevant to notice the addition of the `tissue` parameter that can split the comparisons by keywords in their name (e.g. if we specify `Cerebellum` in the tissue parameter, only comparison that include the keyword `Cerebellum` will be considered).

## Number of overlapping introns {.tabset}

## Distribution of annotation types across comparisons {.tabset}

## Proportion of clusters containing only annotated introns {.tabset}

Lastly, we also represent the proportion of significant cluster in which all the introns are annotated introns. [Source](https://rhreynolds.github.io/LBD-seq-bulk-analyses/quantification_splicing/Leafcutter_intron_annotation.html#proportion-of-clusters-containing-only-annotated-introns)

#' Obtain the introns from significant clusters and comparisons and removes the
#' junction category "ambig_gene". The proportion of annotated introns in each
#' cluster and comparison is calculated and represented.

#' @param annotated list of annotated junctions. Each element corresponds to a
